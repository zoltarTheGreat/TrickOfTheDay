# Trick of the Day

## Airwalk

A no-footed Backside Air where the front hand grabs the nose. Usually the front foot is kicked off the toe-side of the board, while the back foot is kicked off the heel-side, producing the impression of walking in the air, hence the name. Rodney Mullen did it on the flat ground first, while Tony Hawk was the first to do it on vert.
