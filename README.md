# Trick of the Day

## Hurricane

A 180 degree turn into a backwards feeble grind, exiting via a little less than 180 degree return spin. This trick was invented on vert by Neil Blender in 1985; an early proto-version can by witnessed in Powell Peralta’s second video, Future Primitive, during Blender’s brief cameo appearance on Lance Mountain’s backyard ramp. Many of today’s pros also do it on street obstacles such as handrails and ledges. This trick is easier to perform backside, but Tony Hawk did introduce the rarer frontside version in 1989.
