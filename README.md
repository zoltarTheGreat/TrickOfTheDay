## Nosegrind

In a Nosegrind, the skateboard’s front truck grinds a rail or edge, while the back truck is suspended over the rail/edge. It is similar to the nose manual, except performed on a rail, coping, or ledge. Jamie Thomas is one of the few people who can balance a legitimate nosegrind down a lengthy handrail. This move originated on vert, initially in the form of Neil Blender’s New Deal (nose pivot to disaster), then by his more advanced progression of said move, the “Newer Deal”, which left out the disaster part and just pivoted all the way back in. The “nosepicker” is also a fore-runner of the nosegrind.
