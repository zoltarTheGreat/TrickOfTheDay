# Trick of the Day

## Ollie North

Considered the trick of all tricks, this trick was what allowed Flatland Skateboarding to reach a vertical height and gave rise to the merge of Freestyle to Street obstacles creating an entirely new style of skateboard. Streetstyle Skateboarding. Streetstyle Skateboarding became possible when Freestyle tricks were allowed to be done on Street obstacles and the Ollie was the trick that allowed this to become possible. The Ollie was developed by Alan “Ollie” Gelfand on vert. This was done by simply scooping the board up into the air. The Flat ground version of the ollie was then invented by Rodney Mullen. He figured out that with proper foot positioning you could pop the board into the air.
