## 720

The 720, two full mid-air rotations, is one of the rarest tricks in skateboarding. It was first done by Tony Hawk in 1985, and it wasn’t something he planned to do. He accidentally over-rotated a Gay Twist and Lance Mountain suggested that he might be able to spin twice. After less than an hour, he landed it and has done it consistently ever since.[1]  Like a Gay Twist, 720s are usually done from fakie grabbing Mute, but there have been a few different variations. Besides inventing the stock 720, Hawk also was the first to do Stalefish and Varial variations. Danny Way was the first to do indy 720s, Colin McKay and Jake Brown have both done Tailgrab 720s, Shaun White does a Backside Grab 720 consistently, and Matt Dove landed a spectacular pop shuv-it indy 720 at the 2001 X-Games. Bucky Lasek has landed an indy grab forward to fakie backside variation, while Mike Callahan, a one time pro from Chicago has been known to do a frontside unit 720 variation.
