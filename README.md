Any flip trick that gains its rotational and flip direction from the same foot that popped the nose or tail.[14] Pressure flips are executed using a scooping technique. Nate Sherwood is well-known for his extensive array of pressure flip tricks. Most Pressure Flips are performed like Inward Heelflips, because they are much easier than the Hardflip version.
