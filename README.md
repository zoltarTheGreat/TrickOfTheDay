## Layback Grind

This is an archaic variation of the basic frontside or backside grind whereupon the skater leans back (“lays back”) and places their trailing hand on or near the lip being ground,ostensibly to help “push” the grind further. Original Bones Brigade member Jay Smith did the earliest and most popular frontside examples, slashing out violently at the lip with his board while placing his hand well down the transition, in a very “surf-style” pose. By 1979 the move was being taken up on top of the lip (both truck and hand) by Duane Peters, the distinction being noted by the adjustment of the name to “layback roll-out”,or occasionally,”layback grind-to-tail”. The backside version was introduced by Eddie “El Gato” Elguera later that same year.
