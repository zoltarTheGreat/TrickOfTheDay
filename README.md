# Trick of the Day

## Switch Kickflip

(not really a trick but a fundamental again.) Any goofy foot trick executed by a regular foot skater or vice versa. get it, you switch your stance. There is no such thing as switch fakie. (or frontside indy for that matter) Fakie is when you roll backwards with your tail in front, period. If you’re going fakie but your nose is in front then you are actually switchstance because the board rides and feels different.
