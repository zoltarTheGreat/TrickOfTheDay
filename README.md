# Trick of the Day

## Nollie Heelflip

An ollie off the nose of the board. Any trick can be performed nollie rather than an ollie (although they would be renamed accordingly, e.g. a kickflip from a nollie is called a “nollie kickflip”). A common misconception among younger riders is that nollie is similar to fakie. When performing a nollie trick, frontside is still frontside, as is backside, as if you are still riding in your regular stance. Fakie is meant to imply rolling backwards as if still riding regular. An example would be the a nollie frontside pop shove-it which is performed as if doing a switch backside shove-it, only riding backwards.
