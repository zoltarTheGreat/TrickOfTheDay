  description: Is a 360 Spin with another 180 in there so the board almost spins a
    full rotation twice.It is basically a full circle and a half so if you think about
    it in skate lingo one example is a 540 flip where the board does a360 Flipbut
    keeps going for another 180 so it reaches 540 also so the tail ends up being the

- name: Sal Flip
  description: Invented by Salvador Lucas Barbier (Sal Barbier). in motion this trick
    mimics a Fingerflip and a 360 Pop Shove-It. While riding forward, the rider mildly
    hits the tail like a Backside Pop Shove-It. At about 45 degrees into the rotation
    with the leading hand, catch the nose with the palmside of the hand touching the
    grip tape (thumb underneath) with an elbow motion, flare the board forward and
    outward for the rest of the rotation (315 degrees) with the feet up and out of
    the way until the rotation is complete . depending on air time the feet may 'catch'
    the board in mid air or casing the trick at touchdown. On flat ground this trick
    may not 'flare' as much and may look similar to a (palmside) Fingerflip that 'pirouettes'
    vertically using more of a wrist motion as opposed to an elbow motion. The higher
    the rider goes the more exaggerated the movement can be, IE instead of a wrist
    or elbow rotation the rider can actually 'flare' the board with a shoulder motion.

    on the grip tape side of the board for grip. An easier variation involves one
    foot off with the rider grabbing th nose. The skater can also do this with both
    feet on the truck, a 2-foot pogo, of with the feet crossed.

  description: A Strawberry Milkshake is basically a primo no-comply impossible. It
    was invented by Steve Bentley. The skater uses their back foot to put the board
    in Primo position while stepping off with their front foot, then the skater hops
    up to wrap the board around their back foot. They then take their front foot back
    to the board then slam down and ride away.
